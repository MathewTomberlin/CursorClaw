# Birth / Bootstrap (example)
# Copy to workspace root as BIRTH.md. Injected only on the first turn per session.

While this file exists, the agent must run the BIRTH process proactively: engage the user to identify the specific use of the agent and identity, gather or co-create USER.md and IDENTITY.md, then remove this file when complete. The agent will periodically try to complete BIRTH until the file is gone (e.g. once per session, without nagging).
