# CursorClaw resilience

How the framework behaves across code updates, process crashes, host restarts, and Tailnet usage.

## 1. Code updates and restart

- **Restart flow:** The UI or an RPC can call `admin.restart`. The gateway only allows this when the request is considered **local** (loopback or private IP; see §4). The process then exits with a special exit code (`RESTART_EXIT_CODE` = 42).
- **Wrapper:** When you run `npm run start:watch`, the **resilience daemon** runs in supervisor mode (`scripts/resilience-daemon.js --watch`). It spawns `scripts/run-with-restart.js` (the wrapper), which runs `npm start`. If the server exits with 42, the wrapper runs `npm run build` and, **only if the build succeeds**, runs `npm start` again in the same terminal. If the build fails, the wrapper exits with the build’s exit code and does **not** start the app again, so broken code is never run.
- **Hot reload without restart:** Config and substrate can be updated without restart via `config.reload` and `substrate.reload` RPCs. Restart is only required for code or gateway bind-address changes.

## 2. Process crashes

- **Auto-restart with start:watch:** When you run **`npm run start:watch`**, the **resilience daemon** is the top-level process; it spawns the wrapper (`run-with-restart.js`), which runs `npm start` in a loop. If the server **crashes**, the wrapper runs `npm run build` and, if the build succeeds, starts the server again. If the build fails, the build-failure recovery flow (§6) applies (including optional Cursor-Agent fix). If the **wrapper** itself exits (e.g. uncaught error, or build recovery timeout), the **daemon does not exit**: it restarts the wrapper after **`CRASH_RESTART_DELAY_MS`** (default 2000 ms), so the server is restarted even when the wrapper crashes. Optional env **`CRASH_RESTART_DELAY_MS`** (used by both wrapper and daemon) adds a short delay before restart; set to `0` to restart immediately.
- **Queue:** With `queueBackend: "file"` (config `session.queueBackend`), the queue is stored on disk (default `tmp/queue`). After a crash or restart, queued work is reloaded; delivery is at-least-once (duplicates are possible after a crash).
- **Run store:** Pending runs are marked as interrupted on startup (`run interrupted by process restart`) so they are not left stuck as "pending." On the first main-session turn after a restart, if any runs were interrupted, the agent’s system prompt includes a one-line notice: "Previous run was interrupted by process restart."
- **Cursor-agent-cli adapter:** Tracks a crash count for observability.

## 3. Git checkpoints and rollback

- **GitCheckpointManager** (reliability) can create checkpoints and roll back the working tree. The reliability-continuity tests cover checkpoint creation, rollback, and behavior on dirty worktrees. This supports recovering from bad code or config changes when using git.

## 4. Host restarts

- There is no automatic start on boot. The operator (or an OS service / process manager) must start the process after a host reboot.

## 5. Tailnet (Tailscale)

- **Bind address:** You can set `gateway.bindAddress` to the host’s Tailscale IP (e.g. `100.x.x.x`) so the gateway listens only on the Tailnet. Allowed values are validated (loopback, link-local, private, and Tailscale 100.64.0.0/10).
- **Restart from another device:** Requests from Tailscale IPs are treated as **local** for auth (admin/restart). `isPrivateIp()` includes 100.64.0.0–100.127.255.255, so Restart from the Dashboard on a phone or another Tailscale device works when the gateway is bound to the Tailscale IP.

## 6. Build failure on restart (recovery flow)

When you use `npm run start:watch` and the build fails (e.g. after a restart request or after a crash):

1. The wrapper writes the build output to **`tmp/last-build-failure.log`** and a summary to **`tmp/last-build-failure.json`** (timestamp, exit code). It also writes **`tmp/server-down`** with a short message so that scripts or operators can tell the gateway is **not reachable** (e.g. via Tailscale) until the build succeeds and the app restarts. The server removes `tmp/server-down` when it successfully binds (so the file is only present while the server is not listening).
2. The wrapper then runs **`node scripts/build-recovery-wait.js`**, which:
   - Waits for **`tmp/recovery-done`** to appear (or a timeout, e.g. 10 minutes).
   - When the file appears, the script deletes it, runs `npm run build` again, and exits with the build exit code (0 = success).
3. If the build succeeds after recovery, the wrapper continues its loop and starts the app again **in the same terminal**, so the server comes back without you having to be at the machine.

**How to recover when you are remote (e.g. on your phone):**

- **Option A — Agent fixes when the app is back up:** If you can get the app running once (e.g. from another terminal or after a manual fix), the **heartbeat** is instructed to prioritise `tmp/last-build-failure.log`: read it, fix the build, then write `tmp/recovery-done`. The next time you use start:watch in the failed terminal, the wrapper will see recovery-done (or you run build-recovery-wait manually after fixing), and the build will retry.
- **Option B — Fix from Cursor IDE:** Open the project in Cursor. If `tmp/last-build-failure.log` exists, fix the reported errors in code, then create the file `tmp/recovery-done` (e.g. `echo. > tmp/recovery-done` on Windows, or touch on Unix). The wrapper, when running build-recovery-wait, will then retry the build. If the wrapper is not running (terminal was closed), run `npm run build` and then `npm run start:watch` again.
- **Option C — Resilience daemon and Cursor-Agent fix:** When you run **`npm run start:watch`**, the **resilience daemon** is the main process (supervisor mode). It spawns the wrapper with **`RESILIENCE_DAEMON=0`** so the wrapper does not start a second daemon. You can also run **`npm run resilience:daemon`** (without `--watch`) in a separate terminal for build-failure recovery only (no server supervision). The daemon polls for `tmp/last-build-failure.log`. When the file appears, it runs **`RECOVERY_CMD`** if set (default in supervisor mode: **`node scripts/fix-build-with-cursor-agent.js`**). That script invokes the **Cursor-Agent CLI** to fix the build using the failure log, then runs `npm run build` and `npm test`; it exits 0 only when both pass. When the command exits 0, the daemon writes `tmp/recovery-done`, so the start:watch terminal’s build-recovery-wait can retry the build. The daemon does not depend on the main server. Set **`RECOVERY_CMD=0`** (or "" or false) to disable automatic recovery; then fix manually and create `tmp/recovery-done`. Optional env: **`RESILIENCE_POLL_MS`** (default 15000), **`CRASH_RESTART_DELAY_MS`** (default 2000), **`RESILIENCE_WRAPPER_MAX_ALIVE_MS`** (default 30 min — if the wrapper does not exit within this time, the daemon kills it and restarts). For the fix-build script: **`CURSOR_AGENT_CMD`** (default cursor-agent), **`CURSOR_AGENT_ARGS`** (default --approve-mcps --force).

**Important:** The recovery flow runs inside the wrapper process. The wrapper only continues (restarts the app) after build-recovery-wait exits 0 (build succeeded). When build-recovery-wait sees `tmp/recovery-done`, it **deletes that file** and then runs the build; if the build still fails, it rewrites `tmp/last-build-failure.log` and `tmp/server-down` so the daemon can run RECOVERY_CMD again on its next poll. After successful recovery, the wrapper removes `tmp/last-build-failure.log`, `tmp/last-build-failure.json`, and `tmp/server-down`. The resilience daemon removes the failure artifacts after writing `tmp/recovery-done` so it does not re-run RECOVERY_CMD until the next failure. If the wrapper exits after a recovery timeout, the **daemon** (when using `npm run start:watch`) restarts the wrapper. When the restarted wrapper runs, it **checks for `tmp/server-down` at the start of its loop**: if present, it runs build-recovery-wait (wait for recovery-done, then retry build) before starting the server, so the daemon’s RECOVERY_CMD has time to fix the build and write `tmp/recovery-done`; the wrapper then retries the build and, on success, starts the app.

## 7. Command line too long (Windows and long prompts)

On Windows, the CreateProcess command line limit is about 8191 characters. If the user message (or full prompt) is passed as the last argument to the Cursor CLI, long conversations or long prompts can trigger "command line is too long" or similar errors.

- **cursor-agent-cli adapter:** When `promptAsArg: true` and the last user message is longer than 4000 characters, the adapter **does not** pass it as an argument; it writes the prompt to the CLI’s **stdin** and closes it. The CLI must read the initial prompt from stdin when no positional prompt is given. See `docs/cursor-agent-adapter.md`.
- **Recovery:** If you see a command-line-too-long error: (1) Ensure your CLI can read the prompt from stdin when it is not provided as an argument. (2) Or set `promptAsArg: false` and use a CLI that accepts a single JSON turn on stdin. (3) Or reduce prompt length (e.g. shorter system prompt or fewer messages) so the last user message stays under the safe length.
- **Automatic recovery:** The cursor-agent-cli adapter detects command-line-too-long from stderr (e.g. "command line is too long", "argument list too long", Windows error 87 / 0x80070057, spawn E2BIG). When detected and the prompt was sent as an argument (not already via stdin), the adapter retries the turn once with the prompt sent via stdin so the turn can succeed without operator action.

## 8. File and encoding resilience

To avoid process crashes or bad behaviour from large or malformed files:

- **Length caps:** Session-start memory (MEMORY.md + daily files) is capped (default 32k chars); substrate and message limits are applied so that very long files do not blow up the prompt.
- **Missing files:** Substrate and session-memory reads tolerate missing files (ENOENT); they skip or return empty content and log a warning.
- **Encoding:** **Safe read** is applied to user-editable and profile-scoped state files: `safeReadUtf8()` (in `src/fs-utils.ts`) reads as buffer and decodes with replacement characters so invalid UTF-8 does not crash the process. Used for: MEMORY.md and daily memory (`session-memory.ts`), substrate files (`substrate/loader.ts`), BOOT.md and HEARTBEAT.md (`index.ts`), and the memory-embedding index state file (`continuity/memory-embedding-index.ts`, with length cap). Other reads (e.g. config, state JSON) still use normal UTF-8; parsing should validate and catch errors.
- **Parsing:** When parsing JSON or structured content (e.g. memory records, config), validate and catch errors; return a safe default or skip the bad entry instead of throwing so the server can keep running.

## 9. Implemented and possible future improvements

- **Crash auto-restart (implemented):** With `npm run start:watch`, the server is restarted automatically on crash (non-zero exit or signal); see §2. After a crash the wrapper runs a build; if the build fails, the recovery flow (§6) applies.
- **Resilience daemon and Cursor-Agent fix (implemented):** `npm run start:watch` runs the daemon in **supervisor mode** (`resilience-daemon.js --watch`): the daemon is the top-level process, spawns the wrapper, and restarts it whenever it exits (crash or build-failure timeout), so the daemon itself does not crash when the server or wrapper crashes. The daemon also polls for `tmp/last-build-failure.log` and runs **`RECOVERY_CMD`** (default: `node scripts/fix-build-with-cursor-agent.js`) so build failures can be fixed by the Cursor-Agent CLI. Standalone `npm run resilience:daemon` runs the daemon in poll-only mode (no server supervision).
- **Daemon hardening (implemented):** The daemon is written so it keeps supervising even when the wrapper or child fails: (1) `runWrapper()` never rejects (spawn errors are caught and resolved with code 1); (2) the supervisor loop has an inner try/catch so any error in the loop is logged and the loop continues (restart wrapper after delay); (3) uncaughtException and unhandledRejection in the daemon are logged but do not exit the process (unhandledRejection is explicitly handled with `promise.catch()` so Node 15+ does not terminate); (4) if `main()` ever rejects in watch mode, the daemon retries the supervisor loop after a delay instead of exiting; (5) if the wrapper does not exit within **`RESILIENCE_WRAPPER_MAX_ALIVE_MS`** (default 30 min), the daemon kills the wrapper (SIGTERM then SIGKILL) and restarts it, so a hung wrapper does not block restarts; (6) spawn uses `windowsHide: true` on Windows to avoid extra console windows. This ensures the daemon process does not exit when the server crashes or when the wrapper exits, so it can always restart the wrapper and thus restore the server (or retry after build recovery).
- **Wrapper hardening (implemented):** The run-with-restart wrapper catches any error thrown in its main loop (e.g. from `run()` or `buildAndRestart()`), treats it like a crash, and retries after a delay (build and restart) instead of exiting. Only explicit user stop (SIGINT/SIGTERM) or build-recovery timeout causes the wrapper to exit; when it does exit, the daemon restarts it.
- **Possible future:** Run-store idempotency (deduplication after crash); start on boot (systemd/launchd or health-check); hang detection (health-check timeout and kill/restart); Tailnet reconnection docs or behavior when the link drops and recovers.

## 10. Runbook: agent-driven debugging (heartbeat)

When the heartbeat runs (see HEARTBEAT.md), resilience is first: read `tmp/last-build-failure.log` if present, fix the failure or document the blocker in ROADMAP.md Current state / Open; optionally run `npm run build` and tests, then update ROADMAP Current state with branch and build status. Useful patterns for agent-driven problem-solving:

- **Root-cause:** Reproduce (e.g. run the failing command), isolate (identify the failing component or line from logs), fix (code or config change), verify (build and tests).
- **Iterative fix:** After each change, run build and tests; on success, update ROADMAP Current state; on failure, update `tmp/last-build-failure.log` (or leave it for the wrapper) and either fix further or record the blocker in ROADMAP so the next tick or operator can continue.
- **Runbooks:** Other runbooks in this repo (e.g. §6 build-failure recovery, provider-model-support, inter-agent-communication) follow a similar structure: preconditions, steps, and where to document state.
- **When tests fail or are flaky:** Run `npm test` (or the failing subset). Isolate the failing test file and case from the output; fix the code or test (e.g. timing, ordering, mocks). If a test is intentionally skipped or deferred, document why (e.g. in the test or in ROADMAP). On persistent failure, record the blocker in ROADMAP Current state / Open so the next tick or operator can continue; do not leave `tmp/last-build-failure.log` as the only record if the failure was from tests (build may still pass).
- **When the operator or agent needs to run a subset of tests (e.g. single file, filter):** Use the test runner's filter (e.g. `npm test -- path/to/test.file.ts` or Vitest `--grep "pattern"`) to run only the relevant tests. Run the subset to reproduce or isolate a failure; then run the full suite (`npm test`) to ensure no regressions. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if a subset is used for debugging and the full-suite result.
- **When operator reports a regression:** Reproduce from the operator’s description or steps (e.g. run the same command or flow). Run `npm run build` and `npm test` to see current status; isolate the change or environment that introduced the regression (recent commits, config, or substrate). Fix or document; if it’s a persistent blocker, update ROADMAP Current state / Open so the next tick or operator can continue.
- **When the server fails to bind (e.g. port in use):** Check `gateway.bindAddress` and the configured port; ensure no other process is using the port (e.g. on Windows `netstat -ano`, on Unix `lsof -i :<port>`). Change the bind address or port in config if needed, or stop the conflicting process. If startup is blocked, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open.
- **When the provider or API returns rate limit (429) or quota errors:** Check provider config (API key, base URL, rate limits). Reduce request frequency or batch size if applicable; consider fallback model or provider if documented. If persistent, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open and note any operator action (e.g. upgrade quota, back off).
- **When the provider or API returns network or timeout errors (e.g. ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, socket hang up):** Check connectivity (e.g. provider reachable, firewall, proxy). Verify base URL and that the provider process is running (e.g. Ollama, LM Studio). If timeouts are frequent, consider increasing timeout config if the provider supports it, or document in ROADMAP Current state / Open for operator (e.g. network change, retry policy).
- **When dependency or install errors occur (e.g. npm install fails, peer dependency errors):** Run `npm install` in project root and in `ui/` if the UI build fails; check package.json and lockfile for version conflicts. Pin a known-good version or resolve peer dependency warnings; run `npm run build` and `npm test` to verify. If a dependency is broken or incompatible, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open.
- **When substrate or config fails to load (missing file, parse error, invalid JSON):** Check that substrate files (ROADMAP, HEARTBEAT, STUDY_GOALS, etc.) and config exist and are valid. §8 describes safe read and encoding; loader and config code tolerate missing files (ENOENT) with a warning. Fix paths, encoding, or JSON syntax; if the failure is in a profile, check the profile directory. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if unresolved.
- **When disk is full or out of space (ENOSPC, write failures):** Check disk usage (e.g. `df` on Unix, drive free space on Windows). Clear or rotate logs (e.g. `tmp/`, `memory/`, or profile scratch), remove large or obsolete artifacts, or free space elsewhere. If the failure is during substrate or memory write, reduce write size or defer non-essential writes; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the repo cannot operate until the operator frees space.
- **When the process is killed or OOM (out of memory):** With `npm run start:watch`, the daemon restarts the wrapper after exit (§2). If the kill was OOM (e.g. Node heap limit, system OOM killer), check memory usage (e.g. context size, large substrate or memory loads, unbounded caches). Reduce context caps (e.g. session memory cap, message limits per §8), or run with higher Node heap if appropriate (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=...`). If OOM recurs, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open (e.g. "OOM on heartbeat; consider reducing context or increasing memory").
- **When MCP or external tool service is unavailable:** Check that the MCP server or external service is running and reachable; verify config (URL, credentials). If the tool is optional, the agent can skip or retry; if required, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open and note operator action (e.g. start service, fix network).
- **When the build or server process hangs (no response, infinite loop):** Identify which step hangs (build, test, or server start). With `npm run start:watch`, the daemon kills the wrapper after **`RESILIENCE_WRAPPER_MAX_ALIVE_MS`** (default 30 min), so a hung wrapper will eventually be restarted; the wrapper then runs build and, on success, starts the server again. If the server itself hangs after binding, the operator can trigger restart (admin.restart or stop/start). If a build or test script hangs (e.g. waiting for input, infinite loop), fix the script or config; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if unresolved.
- **When the user requests continuation after an interrupted heartbeat (e.g. "The previous heartbeat was interrupted… Continue with ROADMAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md, and STUDY_GOALS"):** Run resilience check (read `tmp/last-build-failure.log` if present and fix or document; run `npm run build` and tests), update ROADMAP.md **Current state** with branch and build status, then advance one **Open** item or one **STUDY_GOALS** topic per HEARTBEAT.md and STUDY_GOALS.md. No separate "recovery" is required—treat as a normal tick with the same resilience-first, then ROADMAP, then study order.
- **When a request or turn is cancelled or times out (user cancel, client disconnect, gateway timeout):** No special recovery—the run may be marked interrupted or not; the next turn is a new request or a continuation. Run normal resilience check and ROADMAP/STUDY_GOALS per HEARTBEAT.md. If the operator reports lost work or duplicate actions, check run store and queue state; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if behaviour needs to change.
- **When log or state files are corrupted or partially written (e.g. crash during write):** §8 safe read and parsing (validate, catch errors, skip bad entries) apply to substrate and session-memory. If a specific file is corrupt, fix or remove it (e.g. truncate, delete and let the app recreate, or restore from backup). For queue or run store, check file format and reload; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if data loss or inconsistent state is possible so the operator can decide.
- **When the operator needs logs or diagnostics for debugging:** Gather relevant artifacts: `tmp/last-build-failure.log` (if present), recent substrate files (ROADMAP, HEARTBEAT, config), gateway or server logs if available, and any error output from the failing command. Summarise in ROADMAP Current state / Open (e.g. "Blocker: X; last failure log at tmp/…; next step: …") so the next tick or operator can continue. Do not include secrets or full credentials in ROADMAP; reference "check config" or "see operator env" where needed.
- **When the operator needs to reproduce a user-reported bug:** Obtain reproduction steps from the operator (e.g. what action, which profile, what input). Reproduce in the dev environment (run the same flow or command); capture logs, relevant state (e.g. substrate, config), and any error output. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open (e.g. "Repro: …; outcome: …; next step: fix or escalate") so the next tick or operator can continue. If the bug is intermittent, note that and suggest logging or a minimal repro when possible.
- **When the operator needs a status or health summary:** Report branch, build and test status (e.g. `npm run build`, `npm test`), ROADMAP Open items and any blockers, and whether `tmp/last-build-failure.log` exists. Keep ROADMAP **Current state** updated so the one-line snapshot is accurate; the heartbeat already does this each tick.
- **When the operator wants a one-off validation or smoke test (e.g. after a dependency or config change):** Run `npm run build` and `npm test`; optionally `npm run validate-model -- --modelId=...` if model validation is needed. Report result in ROADMAP Current state; on failure, fix or document in Open so the next tick or operator can continue.
- **When environment variables or .env are missing or wrong:** Config or scripts may rely on env (e.g. API keys, `NODE_ENV`, `RECOVERY_CMD`, `gateway.bindAddress` overrides). Check docs and config schema for expected env; verify the process is started with the correct env (e.g. shell, systemd, or .env file if the app loads it). Fix or document in ROADMAP Current state / Open so the next tick or operator can set the right env.
- **When a file or directory is locked or access is denied (e.g. EPERM, EBUSY, Windows "file in use"):** Check which process holds the lock (e.g. another Node process, editor, or backup). Close the other process or wait for it to release; if it's the same app (e.g. duplicate start), stop the other instance. For log or state files, consider rotating or writing to a different path; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the operator must intervene.
- **When the UI or gateway is unreachable (wrong URL, CORS, or client not connecting):** Check that the server is running and `gateway.bindAddress` (and port) match what the client uses. If the client is on another host (e.g. Tailnet), ensure the gateway is bound to an address reachable from that host (e.g. Tailscale IP) and that firewall or CORS config allows the client origin. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the operator must change bind address, CORS, or network.
- **When the operator or agent needs to verify that a config or substrate change was applied:** Read the relevant file (e.g. config, ROADMAP, HEARTBEAT, STUDY_GOALS, or profile substrate) and confirm contents match the intended change. If the change is missing or wrong, re-apply the edit or document in ROADMAP Current state / Open so the next tick or operator can fix it.
- **When Node.js or npm version is wrong or incompatible (e.g. "Unsupported engine", ENOENT for node/npm, or install/build errors after upgrade):** Check `node -v` and `npm -v`; compare to project requirements (e.g. package.json engines, or docs). Use a version manager (nvm, fnm, n) or install the required Node LTS if needed. If the error is from a different Node in PATH (e.g. Windows vs WSL), ensure the same shell and PATH are used for build and run. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the operator must install or switch Node.
- **When the agent or operator needs to bisect or isolate a regression (e.g. which commit or change caused it):** Use git history (log, diff, blame) to identify recent changes; checkout or revert a suspected range and run `npm run build` and `npm test` to see if the failure reproduces. Narrow down until the introducing change is found; then fix or document in ROADMAP Current state / Open. If the repo is dirty, use a stash or checkpoint (see §3) before switching commits.
- **When refactoring or renaming symbols across the codebase:** Search for all usages of the symbol (identifier, path, or string) with a project-wide search; update definitions and every reference in code, config, and docs. Run `npm run build` and `npm test` after changes; fix any new type or reference errors. For renames, prefer a single coherent edit pass so the tree stays buildable; document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the refactor is large or split across ticks.
- **When a package or dependency has a known vulnerability (npm audit, security advisory):** Run `npm audit` in project root and in `ui/`; review reported vulnerabilities and fix range (e.g. `npm update`, bump version in package.json, or apply a patch if available). Run `npm run build` and `npm test` to verify; if an upgrade breaks the build or tests, document in ROADMAP Current state / Open and note the trade-off (e.g. pin for now, plan migration).
- **When the operator or agent needs verbose or debug logging:** Check config schema and docs for log level, verbose, or debug options (e.g. gateway, server, or env such as `DEBUG`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `NODE_DEBUG`). Enable the option and run the failing flow; capture stdout/stderr or log files. Use the output to isolate the issue; then turn verbose logging off if it is noisy or sensitive. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open where logs are written and how to re-enable if the operator needs to reproduce.
- **When the operator wants to customize soul/identity or greeting behavior:** Soul and identity live in substrate (e.g. SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, profile substrate). Greeting policy (variance, cooldown) and autonomy state are in config and runtime (see docs and tests: propose-soul-identity-update, autonomy-state). Edit substrate in the profile root or use the propose-soul-identity-update flow if the agent supports it; for greeting or autonomy, check config schema and runtime options. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if behaviour or config needs to change.
- **When profile or workspace root path is wrong or missing (e.g. profile not found, ENOENT for profile dir):** Check config and substrate loading for the profile root path (e.g. default profile, heartbeat profile). Ensure the profile directory exists and is readable; if using a default profile, verify the path (e.g. `profiles/default` or configured path). Fix the path in config or create the profile directory with required substrate files. Document in ROADMAP Current state / Open if the operator must create or fix the profile path.
