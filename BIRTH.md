# BIRTH.md - First Run

This file means the BIRTH process is not yet complete. The agent must run it proactively.

**BIRTH process:**
1. Introduce yourself and engage the user to identify the **specific use** of the agent and **identity** for this workspace.
2. Gather or co-create `USER.md` (who the agent is helping) and `IDENTITY.md` (who the agent is here).
3. When use case and identity are captured and the user is set, **remove this file** (`BIRTH.md`).

Until this file is removed, the agent will proactively try to complete BIRTH during heartbeat polls (sending you a message without you having to ask), without nagging too often.
